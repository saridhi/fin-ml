# # TV Script Generation
# In this project, you'll generate your own [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).
# ## Get the Data
# The data is already provided for you.  You'll be using a subset of the original dataset.  It consists of only the scenes in Moe's Tavern.  This doesn't include other versions of the tavern, like "Moe's Cavern", "Flaming Moe's", "Uncle Moe's Family Feed-Bag", etc..

# ## Implement Preprocessing Functions
# The first thing to do to any dataset is preprocessing.  Implement the following preprocessing functions below:
# - Lookup Table
# - Tokenize Punctuation
# 
# ### Lookup Table
# To create a word embedding, you first need to transform the words to ids.  In this function, create two dictionaries:
# - Dictionary to go from the words to an id, we'll call `vocab_to_int`
# - Dictionary to go from the id to word, we'll call `int_to_vocab`

# ### Tokenize Punctuation
# We'll be splitting the script into a word array using spaces as delimiters.  However, punctuations like periods and exclamation marks make it hard for the neural network to distinguish between the word "bye" and "bye!".
# 
# Implement the function `token_lookup` to return a dict that will be used to tokenize symbols like "!" into "||Exclamation_Mark||".  Create a dictionary for the following symbols where the symbol is the key and value is the token:
# - Period ( . )
# - Comma ( , )
# - Quotation Mark ( " )
# - Semicolon ( ; )
# - Exclamation mark ( ! )
# - Question mark ( ? )
# - Left Parentheses ( ( )
# - Right Parentheses ( ) )
# - Dash ( -- )
# - Return ( \n )
# 
# This dictionary will be used to token the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it.  This separates the symbols as it's own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict on the next word. Make sure you don't use a token that could be confused as a word. Instead of using the token "dash", try using something like "||dash||".

# - The second element is a single batch of **targets** with the shape `[batch size, sequence length]`
# 
# If you can't fill the last batch with enough data, drop the last batch.
# `
# For example, `get_batches([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 3, 2)` would return a Numpy array of the following:

Luckily there's more data!  As we mentioned in the beggining of this project, this is a subset of [another dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data).  We didn't have you train on all the data, because that would take too long.  However, you are free to train your neural network on all the data.  After you complete the project, of course.
